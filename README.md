# Complete Me

In this project, my partner and I built a retrieval Trie, a fundamental computer science concept, over the course of a week, with about two and a half weeks of programming experience.  
  
The project was framed in the context of an autocomplete function, wherein a user could input a substring and receive a list of suggestions. Users can also weight suggestions for substrings so that their preferred completions would appear in subsequent requests.  

Overall, this was probably the most difficult project I've completed so far at Turing, and also the most rewarding and informative. Learning about trees and Tries requires knowledge of several CS topics, including logarithmic complexity.
